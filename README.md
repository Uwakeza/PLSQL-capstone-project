Description of the Diagram
Swimlanes:

Tenants:

Initiate the process by submitting a rental application.

Receive notification about the outcome of the application.

Property Managers:

Review applications.

Notify tenants of the decision.

Coordinate with the maintenance team if needed.

Maintenance:

Receives and updates requests related to maintenance.

System (Database):

Records the application and maintenance updates.

Sends notifications and logs interactions.

Flow:

The process begins with tenants submitting a rental application.

Property managers review the application and decide whether to approve it.

If approved, it may generate maintenance-related tasks.

If not approved, tenants are notified of the decision.

Maintenance teams handle specific requests, update statuses, and collaborate with the database for record-keeping.

Notifications and reports are issued to ensure communication among stakeholders.

Decision Points:

A key decision point is "Application Approved?" that branches to different outcomes based on the decision.

System Interaction:

The database serves as the backbone, ensuring all updates and notifications are tracked and stored efficiently.

How It Supports MIS Functions
Improved Decision-Making:

Centralized data in the database helps property managers and tenants track progress transparently.

Streamlined Operations:

Clearly defined roles and automated notifications reduce bottlenecks.

Enhanced Communication:

Notification systems ensure all parties stay informed.
